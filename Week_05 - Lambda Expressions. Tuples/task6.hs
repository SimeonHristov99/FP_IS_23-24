{-
Define the `Rat` data type that is
the tuple `(x, y)` where `x` is
the numerator and `y` - the denominator of a rational number.
Define a function called `normalize` which will simplify the
numerator and denominator (so that their
highest common denominator is `1`).

**Acceptance criteria:**

1. All tests pass.
2. Polymorphic typeclasses are used.
