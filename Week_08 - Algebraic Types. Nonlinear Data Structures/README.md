## 🌟 Task 1

**Description:**

Given a directed graph *g* with edges `[(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (2, 4)]` define the following functions:

1. nodes - returns all the nodes of "g";
2. neighbors - accepts a node and returns its neighbors;
3. adjacencyList - returns the children of every parent.

**Acceptance criteria:**

1. All tests pass.
2. Appropriate types are created for the graph structure.

**Test cases:**

```haskell
print $ nodes [(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (2, 4)] == [1, 2, 3, 4]

print $ neighbors 2 [(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (2, 4)] == [3, 4]
print $ neighbors 4 [(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (2, 4)] == []

print $ adjacencyList [(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (2, 4)] == [(1, [2, 3]), (2, [3, 4]), (3, []), (4, [])]
```

## 🌟 Task 2

**Description:**

Define a function that checks whether a given path is valid in a graph `g = (1, [2, 3]), (2, [3, 4]), (3, []), (4, [])`.

**Acceptance criteria:**

1. All tests pass.

**Test cases:**

```haskell
print $ isPath [(1, [2, 3]), (2, [3, 4]), (3, []), (4, [])] [1, 2, 4] == True
print $ isPath [(1, [2, 3]), (2, [3, 4]), (3, []), (4, [])] [1, 3, 4] == False
print $ isPath [(1, [2, 3]), (2, [3, 4]), (3, []), (4, [])] [2, 3] == True
print $ isPath [(1, [2, 3]), (2, [3, 4]), (3, []), (4, [])] [3, 1] == False
```

## 🌟 Task 3

**Description:**

Define a new data type called `Shape`. `Shape` must have four constructors:

- `Circle`: with one argument representing the radius;
- `Rectangle`: with two arguments representing the width and height;
- `Triangle`;
- `Cylinder` with two arguments for the radius of the base and height.

Create a shape from every type and output it.

**Acceptance criteria:**

1. `Shape` is a `new` data type in Haskell.
2. Appropriate tests are added that demonstrate what the typeclass `Show` allows.
3. Appropriate tests are added that demonstrate what the typeclass `Eq` allows.
4. Appropriate tests are added that demonstrate what the typeclass `Read` allows.
5. Appropriate tests are added that demonstrate what the typeclass `Ord` allows.

## ⭐ Task 4

**Description:**

Create a new data type called `Point2D` and define a function that accepts two functions: `f` and `g` and a list of points with two coordinates. The function should return those points for which `f(firstCoordinate) = g(secondCoordinate)` and should be able to work with whole as well as floating point numbers!

**Acceptance criteria:**

1. All tests pass.
2. `Point2D` is a new data type in Haskell.

**Test case:**

```haskell
print $ myImages (\x -> x * x) (2+) [Point 2 2, Point 1 2, Point 3 7] == [Point 2 2, Point 3 7]
```

## ⭐ Task 5

**Description:**

By using the `Shape` data type, define the following functions:

1. isRound - returns whether a shape has a round side;
2. is2D - returns whether a shape has two dimensions.

**Acceptance criteria:**

1. All tests pass.

**Test cases:**

```haskell
print $ isRound (Circle 5) == True
print $ isRound (Rectangle 2.5 4.5) == False
print $ isRound (Rectangle 5.5 20.6) == False
print $ isRound (Triangle 5.3 3.9 4.89) == False
print $ isRound (Cylinder 20 30) == True

print $ is2D (Circle 5) == True
print $ is2D (Rectangle 2.5 4.5) == True
print $ is2D (Rectangle 5.5 20.6) == True
print $ is2D (Triangle 5.3 3.9 4.89) == True
print $ is2D (Cylinder 20 30) == False
```

## For home

### 📢 Advice

The tasks have the sole purpose of helping you understand the material better and faster. Therefore:

1. Avoid using external tools or help for solving the tasks.
2. Drop us an email with your question/problem when you have difficulties.
3. If you can't solve a task:
   1. Spend at least 30 minutes trying out different ways to achieve what you want - maybe try to break down the task into smaller tasks and create functions that solve them.
   2. Solving a task manually with pen and paper will help you break it down into smaller tasks.
   3. If the above points don't help, it's best to reach out to us, skip this task and continue with the others. This would allow you to continue solving, while you're waiting for feedback from us.
4. If you are struggling a lot with the tasks, don't hesitate to ask us for a `1-1 session` in-person or via Google Meet 😇!

### 💫 Task 1

**Description:**

Define a function that accepts a graph, a whole number `k` and a node `n`. Return all the paths starting from `n` that are `k` nodes long. If the node is not present, throw an error.

Use the following types:

```haskell
type Node = Int
type Graph = [(Node, [Node])]
type Path = [Node]
```

**Acceptance criteria:**

1. Add one new test case. Place a comment after it with the words `my test`.
2. All tests pass.

**Test cases:**

```haskell
print $ simplePaths [(1, [2, 3]), (2, [3, 4]), (3, []), (4, [])] 0 1 == [[1]]
print $ simplePaths [(1, [2, 3]), (2, [3, 4]), (3, []), (4, [])] 1 1 == [[1, 2], [1, 3]]
print $ simplePaths [(1, [2, 3, 4]), (2, [3, 4]), (3, []), (4, [])] 1 1 == [[1,2],[1,3],[1,4]]
print $ simplePaths [(1, [2, 3]), (2, [3, 4]), (3, []), (4, [])] 2 1 == [[1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 4]]
print $ simplePaths [(1, [2, 3]), (2, [3, 4]), (3, []), (4, [])] 1 2 == [[2,3],[2,4]]

```

### ⭐ Task 2

**Description:**

Let `(x, y, z)` be a vector representing the nodes of a binary tree such that `x` is the value of the current node, `y` and `z` are the values of the child nodes. Define a function that returns the leaves of such a tree.

**Acceptance criteria:**

1. Add one new test case. Place a comment after it with the words `my test`.
2. All tests pass.

**Test cases:**

```haskell
-- you may get slightly different results eg. [3, 4, 5] on test 1 <- not a problem
print $ listLeaves [(1, 2, 3), (2, 4, 5)] == [4, 3, 5]
print $ listLeaves [(2, 4, 5), (1, 2, 3)] == [4, 5, 3]
